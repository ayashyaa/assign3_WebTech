        <h3>My Story</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        My name is Leila, I am 31 years old, and a mother of two children — a son and a daughter (12 and 10).
        I am a designer and the founder of my own studio.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had very few childhood photos (I was the third child in the family, and times were tough).
        But my path to design began in childhood — I loved drawing, rearranging furniture, and helping with repairs.
        I even mixed flour paste to glue wallpaper myself, which lasted almost 10 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        I never missed an episode of “School of Renovation” or “Housing Question” on TV.
        At 11, I already knew I would become a designer, even though in Kazakhstan the profession was not popular.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 18, I entered the Academy of Architecture. People tried to discourage me, saying there was no demand.
        I started as a sales manager in a company supplying design projects. That gave me confidence and knowledge
        of the design and architecture market.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, I worked in a construction company, learning the technical side of building.
        Then I joined a design studio in St. Petersburg, where I gained valuable experience.
        After six months, I realized I couldn’t work for someone else — I quit and took my first independent projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Word of mouth began to spread. It was scary, but as they say, there is no self‑development without risk.
        Now I work in a studio with a stunning view of the city and mountains, implementing amazing projects.
        Today, La Home Studio operates in Europe — something I never even dreamed of.
